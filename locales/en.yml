    - Your privacy is important to us! Your QR code contains personal 
      as well as sensitive health data. To protect this data, it will not leave
      your computer. The processing of the information happens exclusively in your 
      browser. To create the Pass, only a cryptographic hash is sent to our server 
      and signed there. This means we have no possibility to read or save your data.
    - To protect your privacy, we also ask you not to share your Pass with others.
