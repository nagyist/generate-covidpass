    - No matter if you go to movies, a concert or a restaurant â€“ nowadays you have to show 
      the European COVID Green Pass at more and more places to prove that you are vaccinated, 
      tested or recovered. With our website there is no need for an additional app, just 
      scan your code once and add it to your Apple Wallet. And next time youâ€™re in line to 
      show your QR code, you donâ€™t have to search for it anymore â€“ itâ€™s right there, with a 
      double tap on your lock button.

    - Your QR code contains personal 
      as well as sensitive health data. To protect this data, it will not leave
      your computer. The processing of the information happens exclusively in your 
      browser. To create the Pass, only a cryptographic hash is sent to our server 
      and signed there. This means we have no possibility to read or save your data.
    - To protect your privacy, we also ask you not to share your COVID Pass with others.
